# datasci_pokemon_final
The final project for my PHY 231 Intro to Data Science class in college. 

The project was to pick a dataset (I got mine from Kaggle, linked in the project file) and do an analysis of it using python in Jupyter Notebook. 
I chose the Pokemon dataset, which is a csv file scraped from serebii.net, a website that has all kinds of information on the Pokemon franchise.
